Charter proposal for Green Ready Energy Efficiency Network (GREEN)

Background and Motivation

As the imperative to reduce energy consumption gains momentum, network operators increasingly
focus on understanding power usage across nodes and devices within their networks. 
Green networking encompasses deploying and managing network infrastructures to minimize 
environmental impact. This will involve technologies to monitor power consumption, use control
strategies to lower carbon emissions, and foster sustainability in network operations.

RFC 6988 set out crucial requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing energy usage in network devices, 
offering both prerequisites and practical implementation scenarios. However, the absence of 
standardized interfaces for measuring, reporting, and controlling energy consumption across 
diverse network setups remains a significant challenge. Therefore, new models and methodologies are
required to optimize energy efficiency across the network.

Goals and Scope

GREEN WG is chartered to provide the following  deliverables:
   o Terms and definitions related to energy metrics. Where possible, terms and definitions existing in prior RFCs 
     will be reused.
   o A YANG model for component-level visibility of power consumption and configuration of energy saving features.
   o A YANG model for device- and system-level visibility of power consumption and configuration of energy saving 
     features.
   o A YANG model for network-level visibility of power consumption and configuration of energy saving features.
   o A framework for power metric collection and aggregation.

The work builds upon the power consumption metric observability and energy saving management in the EMAN framework,
and upon YANG models developed in the IVY WG as well as other work in the NMRG.  The GREEN WG, will combine all
these concrete approaches systematically so as to evolve energy efficiency in a clear and coherent manner.

The GREEN WG will prioritize definitions of the following factors:
   o port transceiver power information (optical power, status, etc.)
   o port group power information (power, status, etc.)
   o board power information (Volt, Ampere, Watt, temperature, status, etc.)
   o chassis power information (available volume, Watt, status, etc.)
   o power supply information (type, status, redundancy manner, quantities, etc.)
   o fan information (status, speed, tuning manner, etc.)
   o energy consumption levels (basic, standard, deep, etc.)
   o typical traffic models (IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, L3VPN, combinations, etc.)
   o energy efficiency ratios (device, network, etc.)

Out of Scope
Routing protocols and energy aware routing algorithms considering green energy factors are far from mature
and are not in scope for this WG. 

Benchmarking methodology for power consumption in networking devices belongs in the BMWG, and is not in scope
for this WG.

Dependencies and Liaisons
The GREEN Energy working group will closely collaborate with:
Other IETF Working Groups that address topics related to power consumption observability and energy efficiency
management, such as IVY, OPSAWG, bmwg, netmod WGs.
Other IRTF Research Groups that provide research inputs and reviews, such as PANRG, NMRG.
Due to the overlap between IETF and ITU-T SG5/ETSI TCEE, mainly related to benchmarking methodologies, the GREEN
WG will liaise with ITU-T and ETSI for collaboration and consultation.
   o The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), particularly with regard to the TCEE (Technical
     Committee of Environment Engineering).
   o The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), particularly with regard to ITU-T-SG-5.
