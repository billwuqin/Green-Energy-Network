The name of the list: GREEN Energy Efficiency Network
The URL of email address of the list: green@ietf.org 
 
A short description of the purpose of the list: 
 
A list to discuss and coordinate standard mechanisms to measure,report or control energy consumption of network equipment 
under different network configurations and conditions.
 
A more detailed explanation of the purpose of the list:
 
The mailing list will discuss and coordinate standard mechanisms to measure,report or control energy consumption of network equipment
under different network configurations and conditions. 
The energy consumption information include port transceiver power information, board power information,
chassis power informatin, power supply information,energy consumption level, traffic model, eneergy
efficiency ratio, etc. The network configuration(e.g., the number of port, interface type) and conditions (e.g., traffic attribute)
set environment for energy metric measurement and make sure measurment results repeatable.
 
The mailing list discussions are also intended to establish common understanding of the Terms and definitions related to energy metrcs and
the impact of energy efficiency optimization on service quality.
