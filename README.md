Background and Motivation
With the growth of networks and the increase of awareness about the environmental impact, it is important to ensure energy efficiency in the operation of network infrastructures.  
Operators are thus seeking for more information to reflect the power consumption of a network and the contribution of involved nodes.  As described in Section 3.4 of [RFC6988], 
monitoring energy, power can be required for purposes such as:
   o designing control loops for energy saving
   o investigating energy-saving potential
   o evaluating the effectiveness of energy-saving policies and
     measures
   o accounting for the total power received and provided by an entity,
     a network, or a service
   o predicting an entity's reliability based on power usage
   o planning for the next maintenance cycle for an entity
